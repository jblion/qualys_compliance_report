# Qualys CSV Compliance Report Splitter

Qualys can generate compliance reports in several formats.

When choosing the CSV file, it generates a unsual formatted file.

It contains several sections which have to be splitted to ensure we always have the same column's count.

There are 4 parts in this file: 
* a header : contains some information about the way the report has been generated
* a summary part : contains the list of hosts which their global compliance level
* an asset tags part : list all tags of all concerned servers
* a results parts : each control which its status and the expected value

To handle this file, I created two scripts: 
* a splitter : from the file generated by Qualys, it generates one csv file per interesting part
* a Excel file creator : to allow a human to to browser the data

## Limitations

The Excel file creator is unable to handle a variable column's count yet for asset tags.
So, it's skipped for now.
